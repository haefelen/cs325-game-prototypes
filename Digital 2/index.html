<h2>Trophy Hunt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game plays like a standard point and click, but I added a multiplayer aspect, which is very uncommon for the genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The different game screens are actually one connected image, which reduces loading times during transitions. The buttons that control the player's actions toggle each other on and off to prevent any overlap, and update the text to explain actions to the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about groups and mouse input from designing this game. The hardest part was setting up the screen transitions, originally I tried to use different game states and load each image seperately, but the code for that was bulky and hard to implement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most of the assets I made from scratch. The only art assets that aren't mine are the backgrounds, and the sound effects are from The Legend Of Zelda and Final Fantasy.

    <li>Sound effect 1: <a href="http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/QuickSearch.php?q=secret&sa=Search+%28under+construction%29">Zelda</a></li>
    <li>Sound effect 2: <a href="https://archive.org/details/FF7ACVictoryFanfareRingtoneperfectedMp3">Final Fantasy</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game is a very generic point and click, and doesn't necessarily resemble any games in particular. I borrowed some code from phaser examples, namely for sound effects and text design.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Explore a series of rooms and compete to find three trophies before the other player.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I had originally planned to randomize the positions of the trophies each game, but I didnt have time to implement it. The two different play styles are too explore quickly or to search each room completely before leaving.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game attempts to combine point and click mechanics with a competitve multiplayer game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I wanted players to have to pay attention to where the other player has searched and focus on searching areas first.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> 
Each player can perform 2 actions: Move and Search. Moving will change the room that the players are in and Searching will reveal 3 red boxes in each room. Clicking on one of these boxes will "search" it, and add a trophy to the player's inventory if they find one. Once one player has 3 trophies, they win. I had originally planned for the game to be a lot more complicated, but I wasn't able to program it by the deadline. Originally, the players were trying to find items in each room that could be combined to form different traps, which they would set for the other player. However, that would require inventory management, combing, a lot more sprites, and different win conditions, and I didn't have enought time to implement everything needed.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most effective strategy is to completely search one room befire moving on, as this reduces the amount of time wasted.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is no story to the game. The original plan for the game was insipred by games like Spy vs. Spy and movies like Saw and Home Alone.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who enjoy point and click games or low-paced competitive games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than 5 minutes, depending on player speed.
</li>

</ul>
