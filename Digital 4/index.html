<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
There are many games similar to mine, but in most of them, the player has some means of destroying obstacles, usually by shooting. In my version, the player can only dodge and hope that the obstacles destory themselves by running into each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My code uses two infinite loops and one random number generator to generate thousands of potential asteroid paths. Similarily, when asteroids collide, they split apart into two smaller asteroids. Asteroids are destroyed after spiltting twice, allowing for 3 different asteroid sizes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
While making the prototype, I learned a lot about the similarities and differences between Java and JavaScript. In the past, I had only coded in Java, so switching to a new language proved to be an interesting challenge. Likewise, I learned a lot about Phaser, included aspects of design that weren't covered in the tutorial game we made. I taught myself about the Timer and Math classes, primarily in starting/ending infinite loops and angles from degrees to radians. The easiest part of the assignment was implemeting the physics, as I had already done that in the tutorial game and wsa already familiar with how it worked. The hardest part was getting my inifnite loops working properly; for the longest time the spawnRock function wasn't triggering properly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed both assets from OpenGameArt.org, although I did try my hand at creating my own sprites (I'm no artist, and that idea went in the trash pretty quickly).

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game is very similar to the original ASteroids game, released in 1979 by Atari. I borrowed some code from a few Phaser examples, namely the movement controls and the timer/score system.
Movement example: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/asteroids-movement
Timer example: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/basic-looped-event
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Test your reflexes to dodge asteroids for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I did not use any Storymatic themes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used "tank controls," which means that pressing the "forward" control causes the player to move in the direction they're facing, instead of directly up, and that left/right controls turn the player rather than actaully moving them. I used a random number generator to randomize the angles of each asteroid as it spawns. The genre is a top-down multidirectional shooter, only without the shooting aspect, and the play style tends to be very cautious as player try to avoid areas with lots of asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game is testing the movement style, as well as testing for collision between different game pbjects.
    
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to try and anticipate where asteroids will travel, as well as take advantage of the fact that asteroids are destroyed when they collide with each other to position themselves in strategic ways.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player only has 3 actions: Turn Left (Left arrow key), Turn Right (right arrow key), and accelerate (up arrow key). When the player accelerates, they will always travel in the direction they are facing. Every second, the player will gain 10 points, as indicated by the counter in the top-right corner. Every 1.5 seconds, an asteroid spawn at the top of the screen, with a set velocity and a random angle. The asteroids will bounce around the screen forever until they either collide with the player or another asteroid. If two asteroids collide, they are bothe destroyed, and the player gains 50 points. If they collide with the player, the game will end, and the players score will freeze. The game was originally going to be different in 3 main ways. First, the asteroid were going to spawn in form the edges of the screen, but this made the game feel unfair, as asteroids could spawn on top of the player at almost any point. Second, the player was going to have the ability to shoot the asteroids to cause them to split apart, but this made the game too easy, as the player coul sit in the corner and fire outwards and never lose. Lastly, the asteroids were going to have a health value, and be larger and slower the more health they had, but my poor time-management caught up with me and I wasn't able to implement it in time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most effective strategy I foud was to position myself in the bottom-left or bottom-right corners of the screen, as the odds of an asteroid bouncing perfectly into a corner are pretty low.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game has no story. It was never intended to have one, as trying to push a story onto such a simple game might cause it to feel bloated.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of old-school games, and those who enjoy competing for high-scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Dpending on player skill, a single round an take anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes, with gameplay potentially lasting forever, as it will not end until the player loses.
